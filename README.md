# Actions on Google: Audio Recorder Demo

This is a simple Assistant Action, built using Dialogflow, to playback an audio recording. The recording is made using a simple web app.

For troubleshooting these steps, you can refer to the latest [setup instructions for Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart).
